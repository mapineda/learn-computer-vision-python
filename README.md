# Learn Computer Vision - Python

This is a repo to organize computer vision knowledge and skills.
I will be uploading mini-projects and mini lessons on Computer Vision as well as tutorials.

The eventual goal is to create an educational site that teaches computer vision using Python through mini lessons and projects.

## Tech Used:
* Python 2.7
